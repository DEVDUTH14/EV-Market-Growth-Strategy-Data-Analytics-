# EV-Market-Growth-Strategy-Data-Analytics-
Analyzed Washington EV trends using K-Means clustering. Disproved range and affordability barriers, identifying infrastructure as the primary bottleneck. Developed a "Twin Engines" framework that pinpointed 16 high-potential counties stalled specifically by charging deficits.

Executive Summary Designed and executed a data-driven framework to systematically validate business hypotheses regarding Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption. Moving beyond high-level assumptions, the project utilized rigorous hypothesis testing and time-series analysis to isolate the actual drivers of retail consumer behavior. The analysis debunked the "Range Anxiety" and "Affordability" myths, pivoting the strategic focus toward a critical infrastructure deficit that is throttling growth in high-potential markets.

Key BA Methodologies & Contributions


Data Cleaning & Quality Assurance: Processed large-scale licensing datasets, identifying and removing ~22,000 non-consumer anomalies (e.g., leases, fleet sales) to ensure analysis reflected true retail market signals.


KPI Engineering: Developed custom metrics including a dynamic "Affordability Index" (Median Price vs. Income) and a "Twin Engines" framework to measure the correlation between economic potential and infrastructure readiness.
+1


Market Segmentation (Clustering): Applied K-Means Clustering to categorize counties into four strategic segments, identifying a neglected "High-Potential Follower" segment: 16 counties with high income but lagging adoption due to insufficient charging stations.

Strategic Insight Generation: Proved the "Range Race" is over by visualizing a post-2022 plateau in median vehicle range (~300 miles), advising stakeholders that the core vehicle problem is solved and resources must shift to the supporting ecosystem.

Business Impact


Invalidated outdated strategies by demonstrating that state subsidy eligibility plummeted as sales boomed, proving current programs are misaligned with the market's modern "sweet spot".


Defined a clear roadmap for policymakers to target infrastructure investments specifically toward the 16 "High-Potential" counties where demand is proven but throttled.
